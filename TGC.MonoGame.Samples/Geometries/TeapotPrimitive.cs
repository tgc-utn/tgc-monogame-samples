    ///     Geometric primitive class for drawing teapots.
    ///     This teapot model was created by Martin Newell and Jim Blinn in 1975.
    ///     It consists of ten cubic bezier patches, a type of curved surface which can be tessellated to create triangles at
    ///     various levels of detail. The use of curved surfaces allows a smoothly curved, visually interesting, and instantly
    ///     recognizable shape to be specified by a tiny amount of data, which made the teapot a popular test data set for
    ///     computer graphics researchers. It has been used in so many papers and demos that many graphics programmers have
    ///     come to think of it as a standard geometric primitive, right up there with cubes and spheres!
